Syntax Object Properties

Every syntax object has an associated syntax property list, which can be
queried or extended with syntax-property. Properties are not preserved
for a syntax-quoted syntax object in a compiled form that is marshaled
to a byte string.

In read-syntax, the reader attaches a 'paren-shape property to any pair
or vector syntax object generated from parsing a pair [ and ] or { and
}; the property value is #\[ in the former case, and #\{ in the latter
case. The syntax form copies any 'paren-shape property from the source
of a template to corresponding generated syntax.

Both the syntax input to a transformer and the syntax result of a
transformer may have associated properties. The two sets of properties
are merged by the syntax expander: each property in the original and not
present in the result is copied to the result, and the values of
properties present in both are combined with cons (result value first,
original value second).

Before performing the merge, however, the syntax expander automatically
adds a property to the original syntax object using the key 'origin. If
the source syntax has no 'origin property, it is set to the empty list.
Then, still before the merge, the identifier that triggered the macro
expansion (as syntax) is consed onto the 'origin property so far.  The
'origin property thus records (in reverse order) the sequence of macro
expansions that produced an expanded expression. Usually, the 'origin
value is an immutable list of identifiers. However, a transformer might
return syntax that has already been expanded, in which case an 'origin
list can contain other lists after a merge. The syntax-track-origin
procedure implements this tracking.

Besides 'origin tracking for general macro expansion, Racket adds
properties to expanded syntax (often using syntax-track-origin) to
record additional expansion details:

* When a begin form is spliced into a sequence with internal definitions
  (see [missing]), syntax-track-origin is applied to every spliced
  element from the begin body. The second argument to
  syntax-track-origin is the begin form, and the third argument is the
  begin keyword (extracted from the spliced form).

* When an internal define-values or define-syntaxes form is converted
  into a letrec-syntaxes+values form (see [missing]),
  syntax-track-origin is applied to each generated binding clause.  The
  second argument to syntax-track-origin is the converted form, and the
  third argument is the define-values or define-syntaxes keyword form
  the converted form.

* When a letrec-syntaxes+values expression is fully expanded, syntax
  bindings disappear, and the result is either a letrec-values form (if
  the unexpanded form contained non-syntax bindings), or only the body
  of the letrec-syntaxes+values form (wrapped with begin if the body
  contained multiple expressions). To record the disappeared syntax
  bindings, a property is added to the expansion result: an immutable
  list of identifiers from the disappeared bindings, as a
  'disappeared-binding property.

* When a subtyping struct form is expanded, the identifier used to
  reference the base type does not appear in the expansion. Therefore,
  the struct transformer adds the identifier to the expansion result as
  a 'disappeared-use property.

* When a reference to an unexported or protected identifier from a
  module is discovered, the 'protected property is added to the
  identifier with a #t value.

* When read-syntax generates a syntax object, it attaches a property to
  the object (using a private key) to mark the object as originating
  from a read. The syntax-original?  predicate looks for the property to
  recognize such syntax objects. (See [missing] for more information.)

See also Check Syntax for one client of the 'disappeared-use and
'disappeared-binding properties.

See [missing] for information about properties generated by the
expansion of a module declaration. See lambda and [missing] for
information about properties recognized when compiling a procedure. See
current-compile for information on properties and byte codes.

                                        *syntax-property*
(syntax-property stx key v) -> syntax? ~
  stx : syntax? ~
  key : any/c ~
  v : any/c ~
(syntax-property stx key) -> any
  stx : syntax? ~
  key : any/c ~

The three-argument form extends stx by associating an arbitrary property
value v with the key key; the result is a new syntax object with the
association (while stx itself is unchanged).

The two-argument form returns an arbitrary property value associated to
stx with the key key, or #f if no value is associated to stx for key.

                                        *syntax-property-symbol-keys*
(syntax-property-symbol-keys stx) -> list? ~
  stx : syntax? ~

Returns a list of all symbols that as keys have associated properties in
stx. Uninterned symbols (see [missing]) are not included in the result
list.

                                        *syntax-track-origin*
(syntax-track-origin new-stx       ~
                     orig-stx     
                     id-stx)  -> any
  new-stx : syntax? ~
  orig-stx : syntax? ~
  id-stx : syntax? ~

Adds properties to new-stx in the same way that macro expansion adds
properties to a transformer result. In particular, it merges the
properties of orig-stx into new-stx, first adding id-stx as an 'origin
property, and it returns the property-extended syntax object. Use the
syntax-track-origin procedure in a macro transformer that discards
syntax (corresponding to orig-stx with a keyword id-stx) leaving some
other syntax in its place (corresponding to new-stx).

For example, the expression

  (or x y)

expands to

  (let ([or-part x]) (if or-part or-part (or y)))

which, in turn, expands to

  (let-values ([(or-part) x]) (if or-part or-part y))

The syntax object for the final expression will have an 'origin property
whose value is (list (quote-syntax let) (quote-syntax or)).
