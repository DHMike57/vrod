Init Libraries

 (require racket/init) package: base ~

The racket/init library is the default start-up library for Racket. It
re-exports the racket, racket/enter and racket/help libraries, and it
sets current-print to use pretty-print.

 (require racket/gui/init) package: gui-lib ~

The racket/gui/init library is the default start-up library for GRacket.
It re-exports the racket/init and racket/gui/base libraries, and it sets
current-load to use text-editor-load-handler.

 (require racket/language-info) package: base ~

The racket/language-info library provides a get-info function that takes
any value and returns another function; the returned function takes a
key value and a default value, and it returns '(#(racket/runtime-config
configure #f)) if the key is 'configure-runtime or the default value
otherwise.

+See also [missing] in [missing].

The vector '#(racket/language-info get-info #f) is suitable for
attaching to a module as its language info to get the same language
information as the racket/base language.

 (require racket/runtime-config) package: base ~

The racket/runtime-config library provides a configure function that
takes any value and sets print-as-expression to #t.

The vector #(racket/runtime-config configure #f) is suitable as a member
of a list of runtime-configuration specification (as returned by a
module’s language-information function for the key 'configure-runtime)
to obtain the same runtime configuration as for the racket/base
language.
