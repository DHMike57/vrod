Structures as Ports

prop:input-port : struct-type-property? ~

prop:output-port : struct-type-property? ~

The prop:input-port and prop:output-port structure type properties
identify structure types whose instances can serve as input and output
ports, respectively.

Each property value can be either of the following:

* An input port (for prop:input-port) or output port (for
  prop:output-port): In this case, using the structure as port is
  equivalent to using the given input or output port.

* An exact, non-negative integer between 0 (inclusive) and the number of
  non-automatic fields in the structure type (exclusive, not counting
  supertype fields): The integer identifies a field in the structure,
  and the field must be designated as immutable. If the field contains
  an input port (for prop:input-port) or output port (for
  prop:output-port), the port is used. Otherwise, an empty string input
  port is used for prop:input-port, and a port that discards all data is
  used for prop:output-port.

Some procedures, such as file-position, work on both input and output
ports. When given an instance of a structure type with both the
prop:input-port and prop:output-port properties, the instance is used as
an input port.
