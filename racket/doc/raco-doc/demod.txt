raco demod: Demodularizing Programs

The raco demod command takes a Racket module and flattens all of its
dependencies into a single compiled module. A file ">name<.rkt" is
demodularized into ">name<_rkt_merged.zo".

The demodularized zo file can be run by passing it as an argument to the
racket command-line program.
