Mac OS Dynamic Library Paths

 (require compiler/exe-dylib-path) package: base ~

The compiler/exe-dylib-path library provides functions for reading and
adjusting dynamic-library references in a Mac OS executable.

Added in version 6.3 of package base.

                                        *find-matching-library-path*
(find-matching-library-path exe-path          ~
                            library-str) -> (or/c #f string?)
  exe-path : path-string? ~
  library-str : string? ~

Searches dynamic-linking information in exe-path for a library reference
whose name includes library-str and returns the executable’s path to the
library for the first match. If no match is found, the result is #f.

                                        *update-matching-library-path*
(update-matching-library-path exe-path               ~
                              library-str           
                              library-path-str) -> void?
  exe-path : path-string? ~
  library-str : string? ~
  library-path-str : string? ~

Searches dynamic-linking information in exe-path for each library
reference whose name includes library-str and replaces the executable’s
path to that library with library-path-str.

A single match is expected, and the update assumes enough space for the
new path, perhaps because the executable is linked with
-headerpad_max_install_names.
