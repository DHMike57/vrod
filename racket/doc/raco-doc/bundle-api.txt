API for Bundling Distributions

 (require compiler/bundle-dist) package: compiler-lib ~

The compiler/bundle-dist library provides a function to pack a directory
(usually assembled by assemble-distribution) into a distribution file.
On Windows, the result is a ".zip" archive; on Mac OS, it’s a ".dmg"
disk image; on Unix, it’s a ".tgz" archive.

                                        *bundle-directory*
(bundle-directory dist-file dir [for-exe?]) -> void? ~
  dist-file : file-path? ~
  dir : file-path? ~
  for-exe? : any/c = #f ~

Packages dir into dist-file. If dist-file has no extension, a file
extension is added automatically (using the first result of
bundle-put-file-extension+style+filters).

The created archive contains a directory with the same name as
dir—except on Mac OS when for-exe? is true and dir contains a single a
single file or directory, in which case the created disk image contains
just the file or directory. The default for for-exe? is #f.

Archive creation fails if dist-file exists.

                                        *bundle-put-file-extension+style+filters*
(bundle-put-file-extension+style+filters) ~
 -> (or/c string? false/c)
    (listof (one-of/c 'packages 'enter-packages))
    (listof (list/c string? string?))

Returns three values suitable for use as the extension, style, and
filters arguments to put-file, respectively to select a
distribution-file name.
