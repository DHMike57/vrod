raco read: Reading and Pretty-Printing

The raco read command reads and pretty-prints the contents of the given
files. This command is useful for showing how a #reader or #lang-based
reader extension converts input to an S-expression. It is also useful
for pretty-printing a term that is already in S-expression form.

Command-line flags:

* -n >n< or --columns >n<  — format output for a display with >n<
  columns

* -h or --help — show help information for this command

* -- — do not treat remaining arguments as switches

Added in version 1.3 of package compiler-lib.
