Places Logging

Place events are reported to a logger named 'place. In addition to its
string message, each event logged for a place has a data value that is
an instance of a place-event prefab structure:

  (struct place-event (place-id action value time)
    #:prefab) ~

The place-id field is an exact integer that identifies a place.

The time field is an inexact number that represents time in the same way
as current-inexact-milliseconds.

The action field is a symbol:

* 'create: a place was created. This event is logged in the creating
  place, and the event’s value field has the ID for the created place.

* 'reap: a place that was previously created in the current place has
  exited (and that fact has been detected, possibly via place-wait). The
  event’s value field has the ID for the exited place.

* 'enter: a place has started, logged within the started place. The
  event’s value field has #f.

* 'exit: a place is exiting, logged within the exiting place. The
  event’s value field has #f.

* 'put: a place-channel message has been sent. The event’s value field
  is a positive exact integer that approximates the message’s size.

* 'get: a place-channel message has been received. The event’s value
  field is a positive exact integer that approximates the message’s
  size.

Changed in version 6.0.0.2: Added logging via 'place and place-event.
