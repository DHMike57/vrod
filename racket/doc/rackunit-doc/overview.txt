Overview of RackUnit

There are three basic concepts in RackUnit:

* A check is the basic unit of a test.  As the name suggests, it checks
  whether some condition is true.

* A test case is a group of checks that form one conceptual unit.  If
  any check within the case fails, the entire case fails.

* A test suite is a group of test cases and test suites that has a name.
