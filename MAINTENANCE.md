# Maintainer Notes

It is unfortunate that the Racket Reference contains a lot of redundant
docs (via includes). Furthermore, there are often
multiple function docs for a given function name. So you end up with multiple
identical tags, which makes Vim whiny. So youâ€™ll see lots of (innocuous)
errors as the docs (tags) are generated. Just ignore the errors.

To regenerate a new set of text files from fresh Rackets docs:

    cd ~/.racket/6.1.1/pkgs/racket-doc/scribblings/reference
    for s in *.scrbl; do print $s; ~/.racket/6.1.1/bin/scribble --dest doc --text $s; done
    rm doc/data.txt doc/reference.txt
    ./scribble2vim.zsh

To generate the omni list:

    grep -P '\*[a-z=\!\?\-]+\*' $(find racket/ -name \*.txt) |awk -F\* '{print $2}'|sort -u > dict/funcs.txt

An alternative to scraping the omni functions out of the reference would be to
process `syntax/racket.vim`.
